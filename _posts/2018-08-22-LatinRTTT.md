# A growth mindset for learning languages


outline

- open con translation hackathon
- bunenos aires spanish workshops
- bilingual instructor training

In 2015, I was asked to teach a bioinformatic workshop in Spanish in Mexico. I was thrilled that someone thought I had the skill to do that. However, I didn't. I could talk about science in Spanish but not teach programming. Sue McClathcy did.

In 2016, Sue and I traveld to Puerto Rico to instructor training in English. We conducted the course in English, but we chatting in Spanish over coffee breaks and at parties. It was very cool. We hosted a few virtual bilingual demos and discussions after the workshop and that wsa fun but lost momentum. Read more here.

In 2017, I went to Germany to attend OpenCon and worked on translating Software Carpentry lessons into Spanish with Paula Andrea Martinez. Our hackathon session has been immortalized in the promotional materials for OpenCon2018. 

At OpenCon I met Juli Aranco from Buenos Aires, where I went on a 3 month post-PhD sabbatical. Juli helped me organize one lesson translation hackathon and the Software Carpentry Workshop using those translated lessons. During this time, I also co-taught Carpentry Maintainer training with Erin Becker, Jose, and Francois. I'm now pretty comfortable teaching programing and running meeting in Spanish. Now there are 3 stable Spanish lessons each with multiple bi-lingual maintainers. 

In 2018, I participated in two bilingual instructor training events. The first was about 5% bilingual. Sue taught a workshop at JAX with about 20 people, but I skyped in with two prominent figures fromt the Latin RLadies community. Anyways, the 3 of us were in a breakout group demoing teaching the R and Git lessons. Laura Acion and Maria Florecia have already completed their instructor training! The 3 of are continuing to work together via RLadies Buenos Aires and the LatinR conference.

In August 2018, we taught a 25 person, fully distributed online instructor training with partipants in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Educador, Mexico and Peru. Three co-trainers were located in Canada, the USA. Two co-trainers were located the UK and Belgium but are native to Argentina and Bolivia. The first day, the instructors spoke completely in English but the students were encouraged to ask questions or make comments in either English or Spanish. their written responses were about 25% English 75%Spanish. There verbal responses were about the opposite. On Day 2 after lunch, Alejandra translated the "introduction to introductions" episode and taught that  in Spanish. It was great. I had her Spanish written text and her explanation, so I could takes in Spanish without mentally translating.  This was easier than live-translating what Sue was teaching on day 1 with the english text and only my mental capacity and google translate. THe final was a 20 min roundtable discussion about what everyone was excited about moving forward.  It's nice to have a face-to-face discussion and hear each others voices when you've spend 12 hours typing your own thoughts and reading other peoples thoughts. Everyone has the same goal of organizing better training programs for their local data-literate communities.
