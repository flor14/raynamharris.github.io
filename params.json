I study the **neuromolecular basis of behavior **and am involved in several initiatives to **enhance training** in the life sciences.\r\n\r\n## Professional Interests\r\n\r\n• My research aims to better characterize variability in neuromolecular mechanisms regulating diverse behaviors, especially social behaviors • My educational efforts aim to transform graduate training in computational approaches to biological questions • My outreach activities are tailored to promote the sharing of ideas across typical disciplinary boundaries\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\nFor the most up-to-date listing of my publications, visit [my Google Scholar page](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_bVy9pMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).\r\n\r\n## Blogs\r\n\r\nI have written a handful of guest blog posts for [PLOS Neuroscience](http://neuro.plos.org/) and [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org/) on topics related to academic research and education. All of these blogs can be found on Medium at [https://medium.com/@raynamharris](https://medium.com/@raynamharris).\r\n\r\n## Teaching\r\n\r\nI was an **organic chemistry lab** teaching specialists full-time from 2006-2009. In 2012 I was a teaching assistant for **Problems in Modern Biology** in with Dr. Ruth Buskirk. \r\n\r\nIn the summers, I am a course developer for the **[Neural Systems & Behavior](http://www.mbl.edu/nsb/)** at the [Marine Biological Laboratory](http://www.mbl.edu/). My mission is to conduct integrative research and **develop new educational exercises** to enhance the course curricula.  Here's the [molecular lab manual](http://www.mbl.edu/nsb/files/2014/06/IMN-Manual-V-1.1.pdf) I created for teaching neural gene expression profiling techniques. Here's a [30 minute video](http://videocenter.mbl.edu/videos/video/630/in/channel/21/) of me giving a lecture titled Time and money: Techniques for neural gene expression profiling.\r\n\r\n## Event Organization\r\n\r\nI love bringing people together to talk science, especially when I see that these interactions foster new relationships and projects. Working with the [The Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/index.html), I have many opportunities to organize networking events, [yearly symposia](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/dataconference.html), and [training opportunities](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/training.html) for researchers using computational approaches to solve biological problems.\r\n\r\n## Social Media\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/raynamharris\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @raynamharris</a>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>","google":"UA-58133703-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
